# d3-map-viz
This repo contains what I've done to complete 'Information Visualization: Programming with D3.js' course. 

The task was to create:
- a bar chart showing number of routes per airline, 
- a world map visualization that shows each of the airline's targets and destinations, and
- an interaction that let the user show all the routes for a selected Airline

working on: adding a tooltip so when the mouse is hovered on a country its name is shown.
